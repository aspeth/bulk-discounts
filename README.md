# Bulk Discounts

"Bulk Discounts" is a solo project where I built a new relational database table (merchants have many discounts / discounts belong to a merchant) on top of an existing database where merchants can create discounts for their stores, and wrote methods to apply the highest percent discount that is available for an item.

I also consumed an [external API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html) to display the next three US holidays on each merchant's discount display page.
