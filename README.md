# Bulk Discounts

"Bulk Discounts" is a solo project where I built a new joins table (MerchantDiscounts) on top of an existing database where merchants can create discounts for their stores, and the application will automatically apply the highest percent discount that is available for a purchase.

I also consumed an external API to display the next three US holidays on each merchant's discount display page.
